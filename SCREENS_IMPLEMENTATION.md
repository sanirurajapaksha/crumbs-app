## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. User Flow:
```
Home → Generate Tab → Select Dietary Prefs → Choose Health Goal 
→ Set Servings/Time → Generate Recipe 
→ View Recipe Detail (with AI image) 
→ Start Cooking → Step by Step 
→ Completion Screen → Rate/Save/Share
```

### 2. AI Integration:
- **Input:** Pantry items + dietary preferences + health goals + constraints
- **Processing:** Gemini AI generates recipe JSON with ingredients, steps, nutrition
- **Image:** Pollinations.AI generates HD food photo (1024x768)
- **Storage:** Auto-saved to `myRecipes` in Zustand store
- **Time:** 10-15 seconds total (8-10s for recipe, 2-3s for image)

### 3. Data Flow:
```typescript
// 1. User taps "Generate Recipe"
generateRecipeWithAI(pantryItems, {
    categoryId: ['vegan', 'gluten-free'],
    goal: 'weight-loss',
    servings: 2,
    cookingTimeMax: 45
})

// 2. Gemini AI creates recipe
{
    id: "recipe-123",
    title: "Garlic Herb Chicken with Fluffy Rice",
    heroImage: "https://pollinations.ai/p/...",
    calories_kcal: 550,
    protein_g: 55,
    carbs_g: 45,
    fat_g: 12,
    ingredients: [...],
    steps: [...]
}

// 3. Auto-saved to myRecipes
// 4. Navigate to RecipeDetail screen
```

---

## 📝 Code Examples

### Generate Recipe (From Any Component):
```typescript
import { useStore } from '../store/useStore';

const generateRecipeWithAI = useStore(state => state.generateRecipeWithAI);
const pantryItems = useStore(state => state.pantryItems);

// Generate recipe
const recipe = await generateRecipeWithAI(pantryItems, {
    categoryId: ['vegan'],
    goal: 'muscle-gain',
    servings: 4,
    cookingTimeMax: 60
});

// Navigate to detail
router.push({
    pathname: '/screens/Recipe/RecipeDetail',
    params: { id: recipe.id }
});
```

### Access Generated Recipes:
```typescript
import { useStore } from '../store/useStore';

const myRecipes = useStore(state => state.myRecipes); // All AI-generated recipes
const favorites = useStore(state => state.favorites);  // User's favorites
```

---

## 🎨 Styling & Theme

All screens use the theme from `app/theme/colors.ts`:
- **Primary Color:** `colors.accent` (#ff7f4d - coral/orange)
- **Text:** `colors.textPrimary`, `colors.textSecondary`, `colors.textMuted`
- **Background:** `#FFF5F0` (warm off-white)
- **Cards:** `#fff` with shadow
- **Button Shadows:** Coral glow effect

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Required Environment Variables (`.env`):
```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaSyBNGJDo5A0vb4nUhtZs8lR6iZSmqXSgJtk
```

### No API Key Needed For:
- ✅ Pollinations.AI (completely free, no authentication)

---

## ✅ Testing

### Test the Complete Flow:
1. Open app and navigate to **Generate tab** (2nd tab)
2. Add some pantry items (or use existing)
3. Select dietary preferences (e.g., Vegan, Gluten-Free)
4. Choose a health goal (e.g., Weight Loss)
5. Tap **"Generate Recipe"**
6. Wait 10-15 seconds
7. View the recipe with AI-generated hero image
8. Tap **"Start Cooking"**
9. Navigate through steps with Back/Next
10. Complete all steps → see completion screen

### Verify AI Integration:
Run the test script:
```bash
node test-ai-integration.js
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Gemini API is working!
✅ Pollinations.AI is working!
✅ Recipe generated successfully!
📋 Recipe: Garlic Herb Chicken with Fluffy Rice
🔥 Calories: 550 kcal
✅ Image generated successfully!
```

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Recipe not showing after generation
**Solution:** Recipe is auto-saved to `myRecipes`. RecipeDetail now checks both `favorites` and `myRecipes`.

### Issue: Images not loading
**Solution:** Pollinations.AI URLs are direct image URLs. Check internet connection. URLs are valid for ~24 hours.

### Issue: Generation takes too long
**Solution:** Normal behavior. Gemini API: 8-10s, Pollinations.AI: 2-3s. Total: 10-15s.

### Issue: TypeScript errors for completion screen
**Solution:** Restart TypeScript server or rebuild app. New routes are registered at build time.

## 🎓 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### 1. Voice Instructions:
```typescript
// In StepDetail.tsx, implement Listen button
import { Audio } from 'expo-av';

const speakStep = async (text: string) => {
    // Use Expo AV or Web Speech API
    const { sound } = await Audio.Sound.createAsync(
        { uri: `https://api.voicerss.org/?key=YOUR_KEY&src=${text}` }
    );
    await sound.playAsync();
};
```

### 2. Timer for Steps:
```typescript
// Add duration to steps
const [timeLeft, setTimeLeft] = useState(step.durationMin * 60);

useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setInterval(() => {
        setTimeLeft(t => t > 0 ? t - 1 : 0);
    }, 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(timer);
}, []);
```

### 3. Recipe Rating:
```typescript
// In RecipeCompletionScreen.tsx
const [rating, setRating] = useState(0);

<StarRating 
    rating={rating}
    onChange={setRating}
    onSubmit={() => saveRating(recipe.id, rating)}
/>
```

### 4. Favorites Management:
Create a separate Favorites screen in profile or as a modal.
