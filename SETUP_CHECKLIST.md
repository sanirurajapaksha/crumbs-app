### 4. Test the Integration ‚è±Ô∏è 2 minutes

#### Option A: Quick Console Test
```typescript
// In any file, temporarily add:
import { runAllTests } from './app/api/test-gemini-recipe';

// Call somewhere:
runAllTests(); // Check console for results
```

#### Option B: Add Test Button to UI
```typescript
// In app/(tabs)/index.tsx or any screen:
import { testBasicRecipeGeneration } from '../api/test-gemini-recipe';

<Button 
    title="Test AI Recipe" 
    onPress={async () => {
        try {
            await testBasicRecipeGeneration();
            Alert.alert('Success', 'AI recipe generation working!');
        } catch (error) {

- [ ] Image will be `undefined` - handle in UI with placeholder

### Issue: Generation takes too long
**Fix:**
