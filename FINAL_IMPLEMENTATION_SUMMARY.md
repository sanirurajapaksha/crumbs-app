### Issue: Generation takes too long
**Solution:** Normal behavior. Gemini: 8-10s, Images: 2-3s. Total: 10-15s

### Issue: Recipe image not loading
**Solution:** Check internet connection. Images are generated on-demand

### Issue: Recipe not appearing after generation
**Solution:** Recipe saved to myRecipes. Check RecipeDetail reads both stores

### Issue: TypeScript errors
**Solution:** Restart TypeScript server: Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P → "Restart TS Server"
